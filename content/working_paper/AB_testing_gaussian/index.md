# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
Summary: Our contribution is to specialize the A/B Testing Problem (Azevedo et al (2020)) to the case where the prior distribution of idea quality is Gaussian. Using this, we can make clear predictions about optimal sample sizes for the A/B tests.

Abstract:The A/B testing problem (Azevedo et al., 2020) considers how to optimally use scarce experimental resources to screen potential innovations with unknown quality. Azevedo et al. (2020) derive asymptotic results for the value of experimentation under general priors for innovation quality. In this paper, we consider the special case of Gaussian priors. We nd two main results. First, there is a closed-form solution for the value of running a randomized experiment. Second, under certain assumptions on costs, there is a simple solution to the experiment's optimal size. We show, in numerical examples, that the rm's expected prots under the optimal experimentation strategy can be higher than under standard rules of thumb for choosing sample size in randomized experiments (such as power calculations).
